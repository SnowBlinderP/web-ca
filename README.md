# web-ca

A simple certificate authority web application to manage certificates


## Setup

The following steps only have to be done once:

```
python setup.py
```

You now need a CA keypair which is used to sign the certificates that are generated by the web-ca application.
You can either place your own `ca/ca.crt` and `ca/ca.key` files, or you can generate a new keypair like so:

```
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -config ca/openssl.cnf -days 3650 -out ca/ca.crt -keyout ca/ca.key
```

Finally, install the web-ca dependencies (you can also use virtualenv)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running

```
python web_ca.py
```

Tested with python 2.7
